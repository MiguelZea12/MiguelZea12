## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Software Engineering student, focused on the application and web systems development industry.
During my studies I have been able to obtain knowledge in programming languages â€‹â€‹such as C++, advanced Python, which is why I have carried out projects with Python and the Django and Flask framework. I am currently learning to be a Data Engineer, since I am interested in that world.
Additionally, during my studies I have become certified as a Scrum Master in Platzi and carried out projects and recently led a team.
